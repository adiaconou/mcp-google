These are a set of rules for writing code that you should respect.

1. Write modular code and minimize complexity as much as possible.
2. Keep the code well-documented. Documentation should not be overly verbose - it should be concise, and it should be enough so that a human can easily understand the intent of the code and what it's doing.
