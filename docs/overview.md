# Google MCP Server Overview

## Product Description

The **Google MCP Server** is a secure, extensible middleware service that exposes a set of structured APIs over the [Model Control Protocol (MCP)](https://smithery.ai/mcp) for interacting with a user's **Google Drive**, **Gmail**, and **Google Calendar** accounts—along with **Google Docs** and **Sheets**. It is designed to support developers building **personal assistant applications**, enabling AI agents to read, write, and organize data across Google services without directly handling OAuth tokens or Google API complexity.

The server is intended for **personal, local-first usage**, where the user controls deployment and credentials, ensuring strong data privacy and secure tool access.

## Primary Goals

* Provide secure, scoped access to Google APIs (Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets) for use by AI agents and personal tools.

* Normalize and expose common actions via a clean, MCP-compatible interface.

* Serve as an integration backend for assistant workflows such as document management, email triage, event planning, and daily summarization.

* Emphasize user data ownership, security, and control—no external telemetry or persistent logging.

## Target Use Cases

### Calendar Management
* List upcoming calendar events to generate daily or weekly schedules.
* Create new events with time, location, attendees, and reminders.
* Search or reschedule existing events via natural language instructions.

### Email Processing
* Search Gmail inbox using flexible filters (sender, subject, date, labels).
* Summarize recent emails or extract actionable tasks.
* Download email threads and attachments for local processing.

### Document & File Management
* Automatically save email attachments into organized Drive folders.
* Create or update Google Docs and Sheets from structured data or LLM output.
* Search and retrieve documents and folders for summarization or enrichment.

### Content Creation & Analysis
* Read, create, and update Google Docs for notes, journals, summaries.
* Populate Sheets with tabular data extracted from email, chat, or web content.
* Use LLMs to reason over and modify content within structured documents.

## Architecture & Deployment

### Stdio-Based MCP Implementation
The Google MCP Server operates as a **stdio-based MCP server**, communicating with AI agents and personal assistants through standard input/output using the MCP protocol. This approach provides:

- **Simplicity**: No network configuration or port management required
- **Security**: No exposed HTTP endpoints or network attack surface
- **Compatibility**: Direct integration with MCP clients like Claude Desktop
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower overhead without HTTP server components

### Local-First Operation
- **No persistent HTTP server**: Temporary server only during OAuth authentication
- **File-based configuration**: Simple JSON configuration files
- **Local token storage**: Encrypted credential storage on user's machine
- **Direct API communication**: Outbound HTTPS calls to Google APIs only

## Value Proposition

- **Privacy-First**: All data processing happens locally with user-controlled credentials
- **AI-Ready**: Designed specifically for integration with AI agents and personal assistants
- **Comprehensive**: Covers the most commonly used Google services in a unified interface
- **Secure**: OAuth 2.0 implementation with minimal scope requirements
- **Extensible**: Clean architecture allows for easy addition of new Google services
- **Simple Deployment**: Single NPM package installation with stdio-based operation
