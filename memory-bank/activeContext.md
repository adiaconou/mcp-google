# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Implementation Plan Refactored

### What We're Working On Now
We have **refactored the implementation plan** to deliver value incrementally. The new approach focuses on getting working tools at each phase rather than building comprehensive infrastructure first. **This is a personal productivity tool** designed specifically for managing your personal Google account through AI assistance.

## Current Technical Focus

### New Implementation Philosophy
**Value-First Approach**: Each phase delivers working functionality that users can immediately benefit from, rather than building comprehensive infrastructure first.

**Incremental Complexity**: Start with minimal viable implementation and add sophistication in each phase.

**Pattern Establishment**: Early phases establish patterns that later phases can follow and extend.

### Phase 2 Implementation Details
The next phase focuses on creating a **minimal but complete** MCP server with Calendar functionality:

1. **Basic MCP Protocol**
   - Stdio transport for communication
   - Simple tool registry for calendar tools
   - Basic error handling
   - Tool discovery and execution

2. **Calendar OAuth Integration**
   - Simple OAuth 2.0 flow for Calendar API
   - Token storage and refresh
   - Scope management for calendar access
   - Error handling for auth failures

3. **Two Calendar Tools**
   - `calendar_list_events`: List calendar events with filtering
   - `calendar_create_event`: Create new calendar events
   - Proper input validation and error handling
   - Clear, actionable error messages

4. **Extensible Architecture**
   - Patterns that future APIs can follow
   - Modular service structure
   - Consistent tool interface design
   - Reusable authentication patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Each phase must deliver working tools
2. **Pattern Reuse**: Establish patterns early that scale to all Google APIs
3. **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Start simple, add sophistication later
4. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on tools users actually need

### Implementation Strategy Changes
1. **OAuth Integration**: Implement per-service rather than comprehensive upfront
2. **Error Handling**: Start basic, enhance in production hardening phase
3. **Tool Design**: Focus on essential operations first
4. **Testing Strategy**: Validate each phase thoroughly before proceeding

### Current Priorities
1. **Get Calendar Tools Working**: Immediate user value
2. **Establish Patterns**: Create templates for future APIs
3. **Validate Approach**: Test with real MCP clients
4. **Document Learnings**: Capture insights for future phases

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Step 1: Phase 2 Implementation Planning
Review the detailed Phase 2 plan in `memory-bank/implementation/phase-2-functional-calendar.md`:
- Understand the minimal MCP implementation approach
- Plan the OAuth integration for Calendar API
- Design the two calendar tools
- Prepare testing strategy

### Step 2: Begin Phase 2 Implementation
Start with the foundational components:
- Basic MCP types and server enhancement
- Simple OAuth manager for Calendar
- Calendar API client wrapper
- First tool implementation

### Step 3: Iterative Development
Follow the phase plan step-by-step:
- Implement each component incrementally
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Validate with Claude Desktop
- Document patterns for future phases

### Step 4: Phase Completion Validation
Ensure Phase 2 success criteria are met:
- Two calendar tools working correctly
- MCP client communication functional
- OAuth flow completing successfully
- Patterns documented for reuse

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Current Dependencies
- **MCP SDK**: Already installed, ready for integration
- **Google APIs**: Calendar API client library available
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured and functional

### No Current Blockers
All dependencies are available. The refactored approach removes complexity blockers by focusing on minimal viable implementation first.

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] MCP server communicates successfully with Claude Desktop
- [ ] `calendar_list_events` tool works correctly
- [ ] `calendar_create_event` tool works correctly
- [ ] OAuth flow completes for Calendar API access
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user guidance
- [ ] Patterns documented for future API integrations

### Value Delivery Validation
- [ ] User can list their calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] User can create calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Setup process is clear and documented

### Technical Foundation Validation
- [ ] MCP protocol implementation is extensible
- [ ] OAuth patterns can be reused for other Google APIs
- [ ] Tool registration system supports multiple services
- [ ] Error handling patterns are consistent and reusable

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- `memory-bank/implementation/phase-2-functional-calendar.md` - Detailed Phase 2 plan
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Overall project scope and requirements
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `src/server.ts` - Current server implementation to enhance
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Implementation Approach Summary
The new approach prioritizes **immediate user value** over comprehensive infrastructure. Each phase delivers working tools that users can immediately benefit from, while establishing patterns that future phases can build upon.

This approach reduces risk by validating the concept early and ensures that even if development stops after any phase, users have valuable functionality. The incremental complexity allows for learning and refinement at each step.

### Current State Summary
The project foundation is complete and we have a clear, value-driven implementation plan. Phase 2 will deliver the first working Google API integration (Calendar) with a minimal but complete MCP server implementation. This establishes the foundation and patterns that all subsequent Google API integrations will follow.

The focus is on getting real tools working quickly while maintaining code quality and establishing reusable patterns for the full Google Workspace integration suite.
