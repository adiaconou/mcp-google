### Current Architecture Summary
The project has successfully implemented a production-ready MCP server with 15 tools across 4 Google services. The incremental approach (Calendar â†’ Gmail â†’ Drive â†’ Sheets) has validated the architecture and established proven patterns for rapid service addition. Advanced capabilities include document processing, email screenshot capture, and comprehensive spreadsheet manipulation. The system is ready for final Sheets tool completion, production hardening, or Docs integration.

### Implementation Approach Validated
The value-first, incremental approach has been highly successful. Each service builds on proven patterns while adding new capabilities. The architecture scales well and maintains consistency across services. Ready for confident expansion to remaining Google services or production optimization.
