# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: MCP Protocol Implementation (Phase 2)

### What We're Working On Now
We are currently implementing the core MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality to transform the basic TypeScript server foundation into a fully functional MCP server that can communicate with AI agents via stdio. **This is a personal productivity tool** designed specifically for managing your personal Google account through AI assistance.

### Recent Changes
- âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: Basic TypeScript project setup with proper tooling
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Core files created (src/index.ts, src/server.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json)
- âœ… **Development Environment**: ESLint, Jest, and development scripts configured
- âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created structured documentation following cline rules

### Current Implementation Status

#### Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] TypeScript project setup with strict typing
- [x] NPM dependencies installed (MCP SDK, Google APIs, development tools)
- [x] Basic server class structure in src/server.ts
- [x] Development tooling (ESLint, Jest, nodemon)
- [x] Environment configuration template

#### Phase 2: MCP Protocol ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. **MCP Types Definition** - Create comprehensive TypeScript types for MCP protocol
2. **MCP Server Core** - Implement stdio transport and message handling
3. **Tool Registration** - Create tool registry system for Google API operations
4. **Protocol Compliance** - Ensure full MCP specification compliance

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/types/mcp.ts` - MCP protocol type definitions
- Enhanced `src/server.ts` - Add MCP SDK integration
- `src/utils/` - Error handling and validation utilities

#### Phase 3: OAuth Authentication ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 setup
- [ ] Authentication flow implementation
- [ ] Token management and refresh
- [ ] Secure credential storage

#### Phase 4: Google API Integration ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Calendar API client and tools
- [ ] Gmail API client and tools  
- [ ] Drive API client and tools
- [ ] Docs and Sheets API integration

## Current Technical Focus

### MCP Protocol Implementation Details
Based on the existing documentation in `docs/implementation/02-mcp-protocol.md`, we need to implement:

1. **MCP SDK Integration**
   - Stdio transport for communication with MCP clients
   - JSON-RPC message handling
   - Tool and resource registration
   - Error handling and validation

2. **Tool Architecture**
   - Modular tool system where each Google service provides tools
   - Type-safe tool definitions with input/output schemas
   - Consistent error handling across all tools
   - Tool discovery and registration system

3. **Server Foundation**
   - Enhanced server class with MCP capabilities
   - Configuration management
   - Logging system
   - Graceful shutdown handling

### Key Technical Decisions

#### TypeScript Architecture
- **Strict Type Safety**: Using TypeScript strict mode for compile-time error prevention
- **Modular Design**: Each Google service as independent module with clean interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Discriminated unions for type-safe error handling
- **Configuration**: Zod schemas for runtime validation of configuration

#### MCP Implementation Approach
- **Stdio Transport**: Using MCP SDK's stdio transport for communication
- **Tool-First Design**: Each Google API operation exposed as an MCP tool
- **Resource Support**: Future support for MCP resources (file contents, etc.)
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to MCP specification

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Architecture Decisions
1. **Module Structure**: Each Google service (Calendar, Gmail, Drive) will be a separate module
2. **Tool Naming**: Using consistent naming pattern: `{service}_{action}` (e.g., `calendar_list_events`)
3. **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error types with retry logic
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with validation

### Open Questions Being Resolved
1. **Tool Granularity**: How fine-grained should individual tools be?
   - **Decision**: Start with essential operations, add more specific tools as needed
2. **Caching Strategy**: When and how to implement caching for API responses?
   - **Decision**: Implement in Phase 4 after basic functionality is working
3. **Batch Operations**: How to handle multiple operations efficiently?
   - **Decision**: Individual tools first, batch operations in later phases

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Core MCP Functionality**: Get basic stdio communication working
2. **Tool Registration**: Implement tool discovery and registration system
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all failure modes
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for all core functionality

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Step 1: MCP Types (Next)
Create `src/types/mcp.ts` with comprehensive type definitions for:
- MCP protocol messages and responses
- Tool definitions and schemas
- Error types and handling
- Configuration interfaces

### Step 2: Enhanced Server Implementation
Update `src/server.ts` to:
- Integrate MCP SDK with stdio transport
- Implement tool registration system
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Support graceful shutdown

### Step 3: Basic Tool Framework
Create foundation for tool implementation:
- Base tool interface and abstract classes
- Tool registry and discovery system
- Input validation and output formatting
- Error handling patterns

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for MCP protocol handling
- Integration tests with MCP clients
- Validation of protocol compliance
- Performance testing for stdio communication

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Current Dependencies
- **MCP SDK**: Already installed, need to integrate properly
- **TypeScript**: Configured and working
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Jest configured and functional

### No Current Blockers
All dependencies are available and the development environment is fully functional. Ready to proceed with MCP protocol implementation.

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] MCP server can communicate via stdio with MCP clients
- [ ] Tool registration system is functional
- [ ] Basic error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Can register and execute simple test tools
- [ ] Protocol compliance validated with MCP client testing
- [ ] Comprehensive TypeScript types for all MCP interactions

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all MCP protocol handling
- [ ] Integration test with Claude Desktop or other MCP client
- [ ] Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for stdio communication latency

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Updated README with MCP setup instructions
- [ ] Code documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] Examples of tool registration and usage
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common MCP issues

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Overall project scope and requirements
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `docs/implementation/02-mcp-protocol.md` - Detailed MCP implementation guide
- `src/server.ts` - Current server implementation to enhance
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Current State Summary
The project has a solid foundation with TypeScript tooling and basic server structure. We're now ready to implement the MCP protocol layer that will enable communication with AI agents. This is a critical phase that establishes the core functionality all future Google API integrations will build upon.

The implementation approach is incremental and test-driven, ensuring each component works before building the next layer. The modular architecture will support easy addition of Google services in subsequent phases.
