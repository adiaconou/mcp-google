- **Document Processing**: Advanced PDF/DOCX parsing with mammoth and pdf-parse
- **Security Implementation**: Comprehensive security policies and validation
- **Production Features**: Response monitoring, auto-auth, graceful error handling
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive unit and integration test suites

## Current Technical Focus

### Implemented Services Overview
**Calendar Service** (`src/services/calendar/`)
- `calendar_list_events`: List calendar events with filtering and timezone support
- `calendar_create_event`: Create events with attendees, reminders, timezone handling

**Gmail Service** (`src/services/gmail/`)
- `gmail_list_messages`: List emails with filtering (date, sender, labels)
- `gmail_get_message`: Read email content with thread support
- `gmail_search_messages`: Advanced Gmail query syntax support
- `gmail_download_attachment`: Secure PDF/DOCX only attachment downloads

**Drive Service** (`src/services/drive/`)
- `drive_list_files`: List files and folders with metadata
- `drive_get_file`: Get file content with PDF/DOCX parsing
- `drive_upload_file`: Upload files with metadata and sharing options
- `drive_create_folder`: Create organized folder structures

### Document Processing Capabilities
- **PDF Processing**: Text extraction with pdf-parse library
- **DOCX Processing**: Content extraction with mammoth library
- **Security Policy**: Only PDF and DOCX files processed (security and productivity focus)

### Current Architecture Summary
The project has successfully implemented a production-ready MCP server with 10 tools across 3 Google services. The incremental approach (Calendar â†’ Gmail â†’ Drive) has validated the architecture and established proven patterns for rapid service addition. Document processing capabilities and security policies are implemented and working. The system is ready for either Docs integration or production hardening focus.

### Implementation Approach Validated
The value-first, incremental approach has been highly successful. Each service builds on proven patterns while adding new capabilities. The architecture scales well and maintains consistency across services. Ready for confident expansion to remaining Google services or production optimization.
