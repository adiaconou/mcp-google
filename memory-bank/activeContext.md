## Current Technical Focus

### Phase 2 Progress Summary
**Steps 1-6 Complete**: Foundation components are fully implemented and tested
- âœ… **MCP Type Definitions**: Core protocol types in `src/types/mcp.ts`
- âœ… **Tool Registry**: Dynamic tool registration system in `src/utils/toolRegistry.ts`
- âœ… **OAuth Manager**: Calendar API authentication in `src/auth/oauthManager.ts`
- âœ… **Calendar Client**: Google Calendar API wrapper in `src/services/calendar/calendarClient.ts`
- âœ… **List Events Tool**: `calendar_list_events` with filtering in `src/services/calendar/tools/listEvents.ts`
- âœ… **Create Event Tool**: `calendar_create_event` with user-friendly interface in `src/services/calendar/tools/createEvent.ts`
- âœ… **Comprehensive Tests**: 82 tests passing, including 14 new createEvent tests

### Current Implementation Status
**Ready for Step 7**: All foundation components are complete and tested. The next major step is implementing the functional MCP server with stdio transport.

### Step 7 Focus: Functional MCP Server
The next step transforms the skeleton server into a working MCP server:
1. **MCP SDK Integration**: Replace skeleton with real MCP Server class
2. **Stdio Transport**: Enable MCP protocol communication via stdin/stdout
3. **Tool Registration**: Connect calendar tools to MCP server
4. **Request Handling**: Implement initialize, tools/list, tools/call methods
5. **Error Handling**: Proper MCP error responses and logging

### Key Accomplishments
1. **User-Friendly Tool Interface**: Simplified schemas that AI agents can easily work with
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Both calendar tools follow identical patterns for future reuse
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with mocked dependencies
4. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
5. **Extensible Architecture**: Ready for additional Google API integrations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Each phase must deliver working tools
2. **Pattern Reuse**: Establish patterns early that scale to all Google APIs
3. **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Start simple, add sophistication later
4. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on tools users actually need

### Implementation Strategy Changes
1. **OAuth Integration**: Implement per-service rather than comprehensive upfront
2. **Error Handling**: Start basic, enhance in production hardening phase
3. **Tool Design**: Focus on essential operations first
4. **Testing Strategy**: Validate each phase thoroughly before proceeding

### Current Priorities
1. **Get Calendar Tools Working**: Immediate user value
2. **Establish Patterns**: Create templates for future APIs
3. **Validate Approach**: Test with real MCP clients
4. **Document Learnings**: Capture insights for future phases

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Phase 3: Gmail API Integration
**Priority**: Begin Gmail integration building on calendar patterns
- Extend OAuth manager for Gmail API scopes
- Create Gmail API client following calendar client patterns
- Implement core Gmail tools (list, read, send, search emails)
- Add comprehensive test coverage for Gmail functionality
- Validate multi-service OAuth flow

### Enhanced Calendar Features (Optional)
If additional calendar functionality is needed:
- Add calendar management tools (create/delete calendars)
- Add event update/delete functionality
- Add recurring event support
- Add calendar sharing and permissions

### Documentation and Deployment
Prepare for broader usage:
- Update setup documentation with timezone and reminder features
- Create user guide for calendar functionality
- Document troubleshooting for common issues
- Prepare deployment guides for different environments

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Current Dependencies
- **MCP SDK**: Already installed, ready for integration
- **Google APIs**: Calendar API client library available
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured and functional

### No Current Blockers
All dependencies are available. The refactored approach removes complexity blockers by focusing on minimal viable implementation first.

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] MCP server communicates successfully with Claude Desktop
- [x] `calendar_list_events` tool implemented and tested
- [x] `calendar_create_event` tool implemented and tested
- [x] OAuth flow implemented for Calendar API access
- [x] Error handling provides clear user guidance
- [x] Patterns documented for future API integrations
- [ ] **Step 7**: Functional MCP server with stdio transport
- [ ] **Steps 8-11**: Tool registration, integration tests, MCP client validation

### Value Delivery Validation
- [ ] User can list their calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] User can create calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Setup process is clear and documented

### Technical Foundation Validation
- [ ] MCP protocol implementation is extensible
- [ ] OAuth patterns can be reused for other Google APIs
- [ ] Tool registration system supports multiple services
- [ ] Error handling patterns are consistent and reusable

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- `memory-bank/implementation/phase-2-functional-calendar.md` - Detailed Phase 2 plan
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Overall project scope and requirements
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `src/server.ts` - Current server implementation to enhance
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Implementation Approach Summary
The new approach prioritizes **immediate user value** over comprehensive infrastructure. Each phase delivers working tools that users can immediately benefit from, while establishing patterns that future phases can build upon.

This approach reduces risk by validating the concept early and ensures that even if development stops after any phase, users have valuable functionality. The incremental complexity allows for learning and refinement at each step.

### Current State Summary
The project foundation is complete and we have a clear, value-driven implementation plan. Phase 2 will deliver the first working Google API integration (Calendar) with a minimal but complete MCP server implementation. This establishes the foundation and patterns that all subsequent Google API integrations will follow.

The focus is on getting real tools working quickly while maintaining code quality and establishing reusable patterns for the full Google Workspace integration suite.
