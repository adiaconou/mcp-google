## Current Technical Focus

### Phase 2 Progress Summary
**Steps 1-6 Complete**: Foundation components are fully implemented and tested
- âœ… **MCP Type Definitions**: Core protocol types in `src/types/mcp.ts`
- âœ… **Tool Registry**: Dynamic tool registration system in `src/utils/toolRegistry.ts`
- âœ… **OAuth Manager**: Calendar API authentication in `src/auth/oauthManager.ts`
- âœ… **Calendar Client**: Google Calendar API wrapper in `src/services/calendar/calendarClient.ts`
- âœ… **List Events Tool**: `calendar_list_events` with filtering in `src/services/calendar/tools/listEvents.ts`
- âœ… **Create Event Tool**: `calendar_create_event` with user-friendly interface in `src/services/calendar/tools/createEvent.ts`
- âœ… **Comprehensive Tests**: 82 tests passing, including 14 new createEvent tests

### Current Implementation Status
**Ready for Step 7**: All foundation components are complete and tested. The next major step is implementing the functional MCP server with stdio transport.

### Step 7 Focus: Functional MCP Server
The next step transforms the skeleton server into a working MCP server:
1. **MCP SDK Integration**: Replace skeleton with real MCP Server class
2. **Stdio Transport**: Enable MCP protocol communication via stdin/stdout
3. **Tool Registration**: Connect calendar tools to MCP server
4. **Request Handling**: Implement initialize, tools/list, tools/call methods
5. **Error Handling**: Proper MCP error responses and logging

### Key Accomplishments
1. **User-Friendly Tool Interface**: Simplified schemas that AI agents can easily work with
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Both calendar tools follow identical patterns for future reuse
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with mocked dependencies
4. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
5. **Extensible Architecture**: Ready for additional Google API integrations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Each phase must deliver working tools
2. **Pattern Reuse**: Establish patterns early that scale to all Google APIs
3. **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Start simple, add sophistication later
4. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on tools users actually need

### Implementation Strategy Changes
1. **OAuth Integration**: Implement per-service rather than comprehensive upfront
2. **Error Handling**: Start basic, enhance in production hardening phase
3. **Tool Design**: Focus on essential operations first
4. **Testing Strategy**: Validate each phase thoroughly before proceeding

### Current Priorities
1. **Get Calendar Tools Working**: Immediate user value
2. **Establish Patterns**: Create templates for future APIs
3. **Validate Approach**: Test with real MCP clients
4. **Document Learnings**: Capture insights for future phases

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Step 7: Implement Functional MCP Server
**Priority**: Transform skeleton server into working MCP server with stdio transport
- Replace `src/server.ts` skeleton with MCP SDK integration
- Implement stdio transport for MCP protocol communication
- Add tool registration and discovery system
- Create request/response pipeline with error handling
- Enable MCP client communication (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)

### Step 8: Tool Registration Pipeline
Connect the calendar tools to the MCP server:
- Register `calendar_list_events` and `calendar_create_event` tools
- Implement tool execution pipeline
- Add input validation and error handling
- Test tool discovery and execution

### Step 9: Integration Testing
Validate the complete system:
- Test MCP protocol communication
- Validate OAuth flow with real Google Calendar API
- Test both calendar tools end-to-end
- Verify error handling scenarios

### Step 10: MCP Client Testing
Test with real MCP clients:
- Connect with Claude Desktop
- Validate tool discovery and execution
- Test user workflows (list events, create events)
- Document setup and usage instructions

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Current Dependencies
- **MCP SDK**: Already installed, ready for integration
- **Google APIs**: Calendar API client library available
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured and functional

### No Current Blockers
All dependencies are available. The refactored approach removes complexity blockers by focusing on minimal viable implementation first.

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] MCP server communicates successfully with Claude Desktop
- [x] `calendar_list_events` tool implemented and tested
- [x] `calendar_create_event` tool implemented and tested
- [x] OAuth flow implemented for Calendar API access
- [x] Error handling provides clear user guidance
- [x] Patterns documented for future API integrations
- [ ] **Step 7**: Functional MCP server with stdio transport
- [ ] **Steps 8-11**: Tool registration, integration tests, MCP client validation

### Value Delivery Validation
- [ ] User can list their calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] User can create calendar events through AI agent
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Setup process is clear and documented

### Technical Foundation Validation
- [ ] MCP protocol implementation is extensible
- [ ] OAuth patterns can be reused for other Google APIs
- [ ] Tool registration system supports multiple services
- [ ] Error handling patterns are consistent and reusable

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- `memory-bank/implementation/phase-2-functional-calendar.md` - Detailed Phase 2 plan
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Overall project scope and requirements
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `src/server.ts` - Current server implementation to enhance
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Implementation Approach Summary
The new approach prioritizes **immediate user value** over comprehensive infrastructure. Each phase delivers working tools that users can immediately benefit from, while establishing patterns that future phases can build upon.

This approach reduces risk by validating the concept early and ensures that even if development stops after any phase, users have valuable functionality. The incremental complexity allows for learning and refinement at each step.

### Current State Summary
The project foundation is complete and we have a clear, value-driven implementation plan. Phase 2 will deliver the first working Google API integration (Calendar) with a minimal but complete MCP server implementation. This establishes the foundation and patterns that all subsequent Google API integrations will follow.

The focus is on getting real tools working quickly while maintaining code quality and establishing reusable patterns for the full Google Workspace integration suite.
