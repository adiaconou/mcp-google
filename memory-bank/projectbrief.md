# Google MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The **Google MCP Server** is a **personal productivity tool** that provides secure access to your personal Gmail account and Google services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It serves as a private bridge between AI agents (like Claude Desktop) and your Google services, enabling AI-powered management of your personal email, calendar, files, and documents while maintaining complete privacy and local control.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Objective
Create a stdio-based MCP server for **personal use** that provides AI agents with structured access to your personal Google account while maintaining complete privacy and local data control.

### Key Requirements
1. **Personal Use Only**: Designed specifically for single-user, personal Google account access
2. **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your machine with no external data sharing
3. **Security Focused**: OAuth 2.0 implementation with encrypted local token storage
4. **AI-Ready**: Optimized for integration with AI agents and personal assistants
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, and Sheets APIs
6. **Simple Setup**: Easy installation and configuration for personal use
7. **Local-First**: No cloud dependencies or external services required

### Target User
- **You** - A single user wanting AI-powered management of your personal Google services
- Personal productivity enhancement through AI assistance
- Private, local-first approach to Google service automation
- Integration with AI agents like Claude Desktop for personal task management

## Technical Scope

### Core Components
1. **MCP Protocol Handler**: Stdio-based communication with MCP clients
2. **OAuth Authentication**: Secure Google OAuth 2.0 flow with token management
3. **Google API Clients**: Normalized wrappers for each Google service
4. **Tool Registry**: MCP tools for each supported operation
5. **Configuration System**: Environment-based configuration with validation

### Supported Google Services
- **Gmail**: Email search, reading, sending, label management
- **Google Drive**: File operations, folder management, sharing
- **Google Calendar**: Event management, scheduling, availability
- **Google Docs**: Document creation, editing, collaboration
- **Google Sheets**: Spreadsheet operations, data manipulation

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Each Google service as independent module
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- **Performance**: Intelligent caching and batch operations
- **Security**: Encrypted token storage and scope validation

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
- [x] TypeScript project setup with proper tooling
- [x] Basic MCP server structure
- [x] Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: MCP Protocol (Current)
- [ ] MCP SDK integration with stdio transport
- [ ] Tool registration and message handling
- [ ] Basic protocol compliance testing

### Phase 3: Authentication
- [ ] Google OAuth 2.0 setup and flow
- [ ] Token management with refresh capability
- [ ] Secure credential storage

### Phase 4: Google API Integration
- [ ] Calendar API client and tools
- [ ] Gmail API client and tools
- [ ] Drive API client and tools
- [ ] Docs and Sheets API clients

### Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js 18+ runtime requirement
- Stdio-based MCP communication only
- Local-first operation (no cloud dependencies)
- Google API rate limits and quotas

### Security Constraints
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for authentication
- Minimal scope requests (principle of least privilege)
- No persistent user data storage
- Encrypted local token storage only

### Operational Constraints
- Single-user deployment model
- Local development and testing only
- No external monitoring or telemetry
- User-controlled credential management

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- Core Google services (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Sheets)
- Essential operations for each service
- OAuth authentication and token management
- MCP protocol compliance
- TypeScript implementation with full typing

### Out of Scope
- Multi-user or enterprise deployment
- Real-time webhooks or push notifications
- Advanced Google Workspace admin features
- Third-party service integrations
- Web-based user interface

### Future Considerations
- Additional Google services (Photos, YouTube, etc.)
- Plugin architecture for third-party extensions
- Advanced workflow automation
- Enterprise features and compliance
- Performance analytics and monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Google API Changes**: Mitigation through versioned API usage
- **OAuth Complexity**: Mitigation through proven OAuth libraries
- **Rate Limiting**: Mitigation through client-side rate limiting
- **Token Security**: Mitigation through encrypted storage

### Operational Risks
- **User Setup Complexity**: Mitigation through clear documentation
- **Credential Management**: Mitigation through secure defaults
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Mitigation through comprehensive logging

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- All implementation phases completed successfully
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Clean TypeScript compilation with strict mode

### User Experience Metrics
- Simple setup process (<30 minutes)
- Reliable authentication flow
- Fast response times (<300ms for local operations)
- Clear error messages and debugging information

### Integration Metrics
- Successful integration with Claude Desktop
- Compatible with other MCP clients
- Stable API for tool development
- Extensible architecture for new services
