# Google MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The **Google MCP Server** is a **personal productivity tool** that provides secure access to your personal Gmail account and Google services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It serves as a private bridge between AI agents (like Claude Desktop) and your Google services, enabling AI-powered management of your personal email, calendar, files, and documents while maintaining complete privacy and local control.

## Project Status: Phase 6 Nearly Complete - Sheets Integration 80% Finished

**Current Achievement**: Successfully implemented **15 MCP tools across 4 Google services** (Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Sheets) with comprehensive document processing and screenshot capabilities. The project has validated its architecture through incremental service development and is ready for final Sheets tool completion or expansion to remaining Google Workspace services.

- **Screenshot Technology**: Puppeteer integration for email archiving
- **Production Features**: Auto-authentication, error handling, response monitoring
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage for all services

The system is ready for final Sheets tool completion, Docs integration, or production hardening focus, with all core infrastructure working reliably and patterns established for confident expansion.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority Options
1. **Complete Phase 6**: Implement final `sheets_calculate` tool to finish Sheets integration
2. **Phase 5: Docs Integration**: Apply proven patterns to Google Docs API
3. **Phase 7: Production Hardening**: Optimize existing implementation with caching and monitoring

The architecture has proven its effectiveness across 4 major Google services and is ready for confident expansion or optimization based on user priorities.
