# Product Context - Google MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists

### The Personal Problem
You want to use AI agents (like Claude Desktop) to help manage your personal Google services, but face several challenges:

1. **No Direct Integration**: AI agents can't directly access your Gmail, Calendar, or Drive
2. **Manual Tasks**: You have to manually check emails, schedule events, and manage files
3. **Context Switching**: Constantly switching between AI chat and Google services breaks workflow
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Don't want to use cloud-based services that access your personal data
5. **Complex Setup**: Existing solutions are too complex for personal use

### The Personal Solution
The Google MCP Server provides a **private, local bridge** that:

- **Enables AI Integration**: Your AI assistant can directly help with Gmail, Calendar, and Drive
- **Maintains Privacy**: Everything runs locally on your machine - no data leaves your control
- **Simplifies Workflow**: Ask your AI to "check my emails" or "schedule a meeting" naturally
- **Secure by Design**: Uses Google's official OAuth with encrypted local token storage
- **Personal Focus**: Designed specifically for single-user, personal account management

## Target Use Cases

### Calendar Management
**Personal Assistant Workflows:**
- "Show me my schedule for tomorrow"
- "Create a meeting with John next Tuesday at 2 PM"
- "Find a free slot for a 1-hour meeting this week"
- "Reschedule my 3 PM meeting to 4 PM"

**Technical Implementation:**
- List upcoming events with filtering and search
- Create events with attendees, reminders, and locations
- Update existing events and handle conflicts
- Check availability across multiple calendars

### Email Processing
**Personal Assistant Workflows:**
- "Summarize emails from my boss this week"
- "Find all emails with PDF or Word document attachments from last month"
- "Draft a reply to the latest email from Sarah"
- "Download all PDF attachments from contract emails to my local folder"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Search Gmail with complex filters (sender, date, labels, content)
- Extract email content, metadata, and attachments
- **Attachment Support**: Download PDF and DOCX files only (for security and relevance)
- Compose and send emails with proper formatting
- Manage labels and organize email threads

**Attachment Security Policy:**
- Only PDF and Microsoft Word (.docx) files can be downloaded
- Image, video, and other file types are filtered out for security
- Prevents accidental download of potentially harmful file types
- Focuses on document-based workflows most relevant to productivity

### Document & File Management
**Personal Assistant Workflows:**
- "Create a meeting notes document for today's standup"
- "Find all spreadsheets related to the Q4 budget"
- "Share the project proposal with the team"
- "Organize my Downloads folder into Drive"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create and edit Google Docs with structured content
- Search and organize Drive files and folders
- Manage sharing permissions and collaboration
- Upload and download files with metadata preservation

### Content Creation & Analysis
**Personal Assistant Workflows:**
- "Create a spreadsheet tracking my fitness goals"
- "Extract action items from meeting notes and add to my task list"
- "Generate a weekly report from my calendar and email data"
- "Analyze my email patterns to optimize my schedule"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create and populate Sheets with structured data
- Extract and analyze content from Docs and emails
- Generate reports combining data from multiple sources
- Perform data analysis and visualization
